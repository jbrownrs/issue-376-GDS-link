    # OK, I need to hold my hand up to this being a horrible, brittle HACK but I couldn't
    # determine a clean way to do this with the stock Django ORM. We bypass the ORM entirely
    # and roll our own SQL. The general idea is to, atomically,
    #
    # 1. Create a temporary table to hold all the keys for the resources we inserted/updated in
    #    the cache.
    #
    # 2. Insert/update ("upsert") the resources using PostgreSQL's INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
    #    support. If we insert a new row, created_at and updated_at are set to the statement
    #    timestamp but if an existing row is updated, only the updated_at timestamp is
    #    modified. Along the way, we record the keys of the resources which have been
    #    "upserted" in the temporary table.
    #
    # 3. Mark all the resources of the appropriate type as "deleted" if their key is not in the
    #    temporary table.
    #
    # 4. Drop the temporary table.
    #
    # This approach lets us send the list of new resources to the database *once* and then lets
    # the database sort out evicting/deleting resources from the cache if they weren't inserted
    # in this transaction. We could do much of this with the ORM but the native
    # update_or_create() method would involve a database round trip for each resource which
    # quickly adds up if there are 10,000 of them.
    #
    # Django currently does not support upsert natively in the ORM. A "better" alternative to
    # rolling our own SQL is to use the .on_conflict() support in django-postgres-extra[1] but
    # that requires using an entirely different Postgres backend. Using django-postgres-extra
    # also introduces another dependency as a very low-level component which it'd be hard to
    # migrate from if it becomes abandoned.
