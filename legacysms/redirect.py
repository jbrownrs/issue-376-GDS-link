"""
Occasionally we may want to redirect incoming requests back to the legacy SMS. For example, if we
are asked to generate an embed view for a video which is not in the JWPlatform database, we don't
know if that is because the video doesn't exist or if that is because the video has not yet been
imported. In this case, we redirect back to a special SMS URL which handles the request for us.
