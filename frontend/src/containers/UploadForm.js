/**
 * A container component which takes a media item resource and upload endpoint via its props and
 * provides the upload flow.
 *
 * This is a somewhat complicated container in that it attempts to make sure that as much
 * interaction is possible, even before the item or upload endpoint resources are available. To
 * that end, it separates the selection of the file from the initiation of the upload. The user can
 * proceed to enter item metadata but can only publish the item when both the original item
 * resource and upload endpoint resource have been set.
 *
 * Once the user has selected a file *AND* the we have retrieved an upload endpoint, we upload the
 * file. We use XMLHttpRequest to upload the file so that we can give progress information to the
 * user.
 *
 * Once the upload has completed, the publish button is no longer disabled and we "publish" the
 * item by PUT-ing the new metadata via the API.
